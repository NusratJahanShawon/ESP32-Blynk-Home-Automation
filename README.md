# ESP32-Blynk-Home-Automation
ESP32 Digital Home Automation with Blynk
This project demonstrates a home automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller and Blynk. The system controls various sensors and relays, allowing remote monitoring and automation via the Blynk app.
Features:
Sensors Used: MQ-2, MQ-5, PIR Motion Sensor, LDR, Flame Sensor.
Real-time Monitoring: Sensor data for gas, motion, flame, and light levels is sent to the Blynk app for easy monitoring.
Relay Control: Activates relays based on sensor data, such as detecting gas, flames, darkness, or motion, to control home devices.
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Utilizes the ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi to connect and communicate with the Blynk server.
Event Logging: Sends notifications to the Blynk app when events such as motion detection or gas leakage are triggered.
This project showcases ESP32, Blynk integration, and basic automation logic for controlling home devices remotely.
